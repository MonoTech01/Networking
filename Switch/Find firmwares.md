- Every switch will have a different firmware, so please be careful when selecting it!
- Upgrading the switch with an inapproriate firmware can ruin the process. If this happens, you might have to spend extra time to troubleshooting the problems.
- In some cases, you have to create an account under your commany's domain to access to an official website of your switch brand.

For example,
HP firmwares will be found in this following website: https://networkingsupport.hpe.com/

However, I realized that some people could not find the site when they search HP firmware on google. They usually ended up with this site: https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html
I figured out the way to get to the correct site from it!
